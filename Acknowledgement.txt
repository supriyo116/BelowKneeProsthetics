Acknowledgement Note
I would like to extend my heartfelt gratitude to my project team members for their dedication and exceptional contributions, which were instrumental in the successful completion of our project on developing a below-the-knee prosthetic using EMG sensors.

Special thanks to:

Satvik Jain (2022UEE0148)
Ananya Garg (2022UMT0162)
Sanjhali Srivastava (2022UMT0180)

My specific contributions to the project included:

Writing code for data collection, filtration, and optimization.
Using machine learning to predict angles based on EMG sensor data.
Implementing the ML-predicted angle on motor movements to achieve the desired angle for the prosthetic limb.
Thank you all for your unwavering support and collaboration. Together, we have made significant strides in advancing prosthetic technology.
