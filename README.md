# BelowKneeProsthetics
 This EMG-controlled prosthetic leg project (below-knee) improves amputee mobility with machine learning. EMG sensors capture muscle signals, combined with real-time joint data, for a machine learning model to predict final leg position. Build includes EMG circuitry, bend sensors, and Raspberry Pi control
